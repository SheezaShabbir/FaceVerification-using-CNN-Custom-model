    <h1>Face Verification</h1>
    <p>Implementing a model that can verify if two images belongs to same personality or not. Answer the question "Is this the claimed person?" It is a 1:1 matching problem i.e. given a face your task is to compare the candidate face to another and verify whether it is a match or not. My custom CNN model has achieved marvelous performance on the dataset.
